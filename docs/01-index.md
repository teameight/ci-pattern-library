Hi team,

This is a preview of the pattern library. You can view components by clicking the links to the left. They are nested under **Elements** and **Modules**.

- Elements are the most granular single bits of content.
- Modules are groupings of one or more Elements to create larger components.

When viewing components, be sure to check out out the markup in the HTML tab. Generally speaking, we are planning to be create new, namespaced class names for everything that will be applied on both the marketing site and the DMS. Does this present any issues on your end?

Our current plan for the CSS is to generate a new stylesheet that sits next to the current DMS stylesheet. If there are any collisions with existing styles we will edit the current stylesheet to address them rather than adjust the new one. Eventually, the goal will be for the new stylesheet to replace the old one completely.

Again, this is just a preview of what the final pattern library will be so please let me know if you have any input on how it can be improved to better suit your workflow.

Thanks!
