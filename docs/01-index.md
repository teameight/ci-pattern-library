title: Children Incorporated Design System
---

Welcome to the design system for Children Incorporated. This is a resource for all of the components used to create the marketing website and Donor Management System site.

You can view components by clicking the links to the left. They are nested under **Elements** and **Modules**.

- Elements are the most granular single bits of content.
- Modules are groupings of one or more Elements to create larger components.

When viewing components, you will see a rendered example as well as metadata. For our purposes we will mostly be using the **HTML** tab and the **Notes** tab.

The HTML tab shows the markup used to create the component in question. You can copy and paste that markup into a template and as long as the correct stylesheet is included it should just work.

The Notes tab may include additional information about the component, possibly including caveats or best practices for using the component.
