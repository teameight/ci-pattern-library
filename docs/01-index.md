Hi team,

This is a preview of the pattern library. You can view components by clicking the links to the left. They are nested under **Elements** and **Modules**.

- Elements are the most granular single bits of content.
- Modules are groupings of one or more Elements to create larger components.

When viewing components, be sure to check out out the markup in the HTML tab. Let me know if the current formatting presents any issues as far as ability/desire to refactor existing code.

Thanks!
